% left and right options become inner and outer margins The default horizontal
% latex margin ratio is 2:3. The default vertical top:bottom margin ratio is 2:3
% also. You can also set it directly by passing the hmarginratio option to the
% geometry package, as in
% \usepackage[top=1in,left=1in,vmarginratio=2:3,hmarginratio=2:5,twoside]{geometry}
